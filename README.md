# __Whale Off the Portfolio__

## Comparing the Performance of Various Investment Portfolios to the S&P 500 Index Performance. 

### Project Purpose:
This tool can be used to compare the performance of multiple algorithmic trading strategies across multiple areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios.

### Project Overview:
The analysis notebook analyzes and visualizes major metrics of portfolios across all of these areas, and helps to determine which portfolio(s) outperform the others. For demonstration, it uses historical daily returns of several portfolios: some from algorithmic portfolios, some that represent the portfolios of famous "whale" investors like Warren Buffett, and some from big hedge and mutual funds. We can then use the analysis to create a custom portfolio and compare its performance to that of the other portfolios, as well as the larger market ([S&P 500 Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P/TSX_60)).
